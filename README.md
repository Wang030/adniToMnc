# adniToMnc

Second attempt at integrating ADNI new files into the MCSA database architecture.
Also converts DICOM files into MNC files, detect non-compliant files, and find corresponding T1-MRI files in already existing database.
This project has been superseded by a third attempt using a MySQL database: https://github.com/Wang030/Processing_Pipeline
